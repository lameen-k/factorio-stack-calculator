# Factorio Stack Calculator

This is a small helper app that simply shows the amount of items that can fit into a Chest, Train wagon, or Spidertron. I built it for myself because I'm a lazy person and tired of checking the stack size every time, then opening a calculator when building circuits for my train stops or planning blueprints. If you haven't heard about it yet and you're living under a rock, this helper app is for the game called **Factorio**.

The app is built using `Vite + React & TypeScript`. Please don't judge the code; I didn't spend much time on it (I'm not building a SaaS App).

## Demo example
